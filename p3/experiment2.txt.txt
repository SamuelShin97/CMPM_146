The modified version beat the vanilla version 100 times which is a complete blowout. When changing the tree size of the modified version to 100 and keeping the vanilla at 1000, Vanilla would consistently beat the modified version. But when modified had 500 nodes and Vanilla still had 1000 nodes, modified was actually consistently beating the vanilla version despite having half the search space as the vanilla version. 
This can be translated as a tradeoff between having a lot of information or having good information or between quality and quantity. Having better information is important, but having information at all is also important. Sometimes it is better to spend time getting more information than getting better information or vice versa.
Note that the modified version was always player 2 meaning it was always at the slight disadvantage of moving second.
