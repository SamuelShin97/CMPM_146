When we put the vanilla_timer bot and the modified_timer bot against each other, we found that the modified_timer bot won more because there is little to no difference in terms of computing time between the two algorithms. The modified version has one to two more if statements and the time it takes to compute for both algorithms is relatively the same. Therefore, the modified version was able to win more despite having the same/slightly smaller tree as the vanilla bot. Yes, the vanilla bot theoretically has more time to create a larger search tree, but the quality of the modified bot far surpassed that of the vanilla bot. If our modified algorithm was more complex, the difference between both trees would be noticeably bigger; the vanilla algorithm as the one with the bigger tree. However, in our case, as time variates, the results don’t really differ due to the computing time of the two algorithms to be the same.
